This is my submission for the Yelp Dataset Challenge 2018.
The main script is called yelpMealReviews.py that analyses the reviews for each restaurant
to find the average score for each meal and write it back to the Yelp database in SQL.
The sentiment analysis scripts are a test of the ability for doing sentiment analysis on
each of the reviews as a way of double checking that the number of stars is consistent with
the way the user described the meal, but it is not implemented fully yet.
